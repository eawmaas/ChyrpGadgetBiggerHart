Give Chyrp Lite a bigger hart

##-I call it a gadget, it's just for fun and for me: I like a bigger heart in the Blog, maybe more people will.

Add to `a.likes > img {` in themes/youractivetheme/stylesheets/all.css line 761 the next two lines and adjust the sizes as you wish:

	width: 4em;
	height: 4em;
 
##-This should do it
